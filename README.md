# PDF-QA-Model

**PDF-QA-Model** is a machine learning-based application that enables users to extract information from PDF documents through a question-answering interface. By uploading a PDF, users can ask specific questions, and the system provides relevant answers based on the document's content. This project uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model fine-tuned for question-answering tasks, paired with the Tika library for PDF text extraction.

## Features:
- **PDF Upload**: Upload any PDF document to extract its text content.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions related to the document, and get answers from the extracted text.
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the model's confidence level in its answers.
- **Gradio Interface**: Simple and interactive user interface for seamless interactions.

## Technologies:
- **Python**
- **Gradio**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **Tika**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: For using the pre-trained DistilBERT model for question answering.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for running the model.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PDF-QA-Model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd PDF-QA-Model
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open the local URL provided (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860) to interact with the model.

## Usage:
1. Upload a PDF document via the Gradio interface.
2. Ask a question based on the document's content.
3. Receive an answer along with a confidence score.
